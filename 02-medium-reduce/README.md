#Instructions

Please use the seed from the task `easy-starter` and implement `.map`, `.filter`, `.reduce` in TypeScript and describe what they do. Please do not use the first simple solution you find on internet (we saw all already), but rather come up with your own idea of an interesting example.


#Notes

Implementations of map(), filter() and reduce() are based on descriptions of corresponding Javascript's functions
Array.prototype.map() - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map
Array.prototype.filter() - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter
Array.prototype.reduce() - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce
