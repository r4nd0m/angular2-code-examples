# Timing

~3.5 hrs trying to make it work with the seed project
~0.5 hrs installing using angular-cli
~4.5 hrs to build a component

#Instructions

Please use the seed from the task `easy-starter` and integrate D3 library into it.

We want to import the library as `import * as d3 from ‘d3’;`.

Then choose one UI element from an image and implement it. UI elements are left menu, graf, CPU circles and process bars.
